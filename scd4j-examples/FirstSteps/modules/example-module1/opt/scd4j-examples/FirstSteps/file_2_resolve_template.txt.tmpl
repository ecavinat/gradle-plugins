This file is a template which will be resolved before be copied to the destination folder. We specify this behaviour providing '.tmpl' scd4j extension

A template is very useful whenever you need to change a file during the installation process. For example, the gaps in the License below will be fulfilled after scd4j has run

Please, after you have run scd4j in this module, check the result file at: /opt/scd4j-examples/FirstSteps/file_2_resolve_template.txt

It is also important to say that we have many options for templating. They are:
	- Groovy Templates (default)
		* It is a very powerful JSP like template engine where in EL expressions you can use groovy code 
		* see documentation at http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates		
	- Apache Velocity
		* It is a very well known (for Java developers) template engine which, unfortunately, is not being updated lately  
		* see documentation at https://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.7/user-guide.html
	- Mustache
		* It is a very well known (for JavaScript developers) and powerful template engine 	
		* see documentation at http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html OR https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java
	- Handlebars
		* It is a super set of Mustache template engine	
		* see documentation at https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java  

The default template engine used by scd4j is Groovy Templates. However, you change this in settings of scd4j in build.gradle file. For example:

	scd4j {
		install {
			modules .. 
			config ..		
		}	
		settings {
			template {
				engine "mustache"
			}
		}
	}

The options you can provide in 'settings > template > engine' are:
	- "groovy" 		for Groovy Templates (default)
	- "velocity" 	for Apache Velocity
	- "mustache" 	for Mustache
	- "handlebars" 	for Handlebars
